Hi! I'm @WelMelo, I'm Brazilian, and you can call me Wellington. 
I'm 15 years old and I'm starting in the world of programming because it caught my attention and interest in recent times. 
I see that it really will be the profession of the future!

I am currently learning to use CSS in my HTML codes, 
and my next step in learning will be to learn JavaScript and PHP.

I am joining GitHub because I saw many recommendations on this site, 
and that here I can host my personal projects where I am practicing what I learn.

In addition, I want to collaborate with whatever 
is possible on open source projects here on GitHub.
